<h1>The navigation API is moving to the HTML Standard!</h1>

<p>The best specification for the navigation API currently lives as a draft pull request against the HTML Standard: <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8502">whatwg/html#8502</a>. You can also view a <a href="https://whatpr.org/html/8502/nav-history-apis.html#navigation-api">PR preview</a>. Compared to previous versions that lived at this URL, a few bugs were fixed, several terms were renamed, and many monkeypatches were moved to the appropriate location.</p>

<p>Once that PR is merged, this URL will redirect to the final specification.</p>
